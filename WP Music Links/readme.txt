Adds links to social networks of artists and festivals easily in your posts.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create a database for social networks of artists and festivals to include in your music weblog posts. You can add them manually, but the program will also try to get them by itself from Music Brainz, the Wikipedia for music.

== Installation ==

Just upload your plugin and activate it. It will create the database tables needed for its correct working and it will add manualy one example: Metallica.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I store links for other type of items such as agencies, labels...? =

Right now the plugin supports just artists and festivals, but eventually in a future version will accept this.

= Why can't I change the order of the links? =

Well, it will also be updated (hopefully) in the next version.

= 0.1 =
* Basic working getting information automaticly from MusicBrainz or manually. 
* Also successful editing process.
